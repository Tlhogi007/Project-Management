# General Info
On this project I created this simple dashboard using only flexbox. Using this tool, i wanted to demonstrate the full power of flexbox.

Why Flexbox?

Flexbox is a next-generation tool to help you create layouts with CSS; whether you want to lay out a section of your website or display a grid of media elements.
It enables you to easily align, centre, justify, scale and reorder elements on your page, without having to resort to nasty CSS hacks or fragile JavaScript dependencies.

Flexbox can replace floats, positioning tricks, inline-block layouts and even – shudder – table display layouts. 
If you have ever pulled your hair out wondering why some seemingly simple layouts were difficult or even impossible in CSS, you are going to love Flexbox.
